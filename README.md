# Praktikum-WP
A simple portfolio website.

This site was made for another Web programming course at the beginning of 2018.
The main goal of this project was to make a responsive site without usage of Bootstrap.
New stuff I learnt here was SASS, Web Storage, Google Maps integration and the basics of prototyping.
At this point I still didn't learn about backend technologies.
